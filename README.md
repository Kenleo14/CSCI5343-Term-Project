Topics can include, but are not limited to:

    Role of LLMs  (SLMs) on code generation and alrogithms and software engineering
    The efficiency of generated code by LLMs (SLMs)
    EffiBench bechamrk dataset consists of 1000 problems based on different algorithms such as dynamic programming, binary search, greedy, sorting etc. with different difficulty levels as easy, medium and hard that are sourced from the LeetCode and paired with the best human-written solutions to compare the efficiency metrics.
    Pick one algorithmis paradigm from dynamic programming, binary search, greedy, sorting etc. , for example, all the Greedy Algorithm problems with 32 easy level, 170 problems with medium difficulty level and 41 problems with hard level was selected from the EffiBench dataset. 
    Choose 10 problems at each level and compare the execution times of the human generated code with those generated by three selected LLMs.
