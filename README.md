https://tamusa.blackboard.com/ultra/courses/_268909_1/cl/outline

test_cases.py currently only runs tests for the human generated code located in binary_search_data.json. This outputs the execution time for each of the 30 problems. Working on adding functionality for reading/executing LLM generated code saved in LLM folders.

The problem sets located in "binary_search_data.json" are extracted from the original data.json using the clean_data.py script. See "data" folder.
